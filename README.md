# Hybrid genome assembly of the King Angelfish (*Holacanthus passer*) gives insight into the evolution of marine fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific 

Here you will find a stepthrough to the entire *Holacanthus passer* genome assembly protocol carried out using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing. The genome assembly pipeline is illustrated below. Other step by step methods used to assess and analyse data (e.g. GenomeScope and PSMC) are also shared. 

Overall the goal of this page was to write a tutorial for my labmates but also applies to help early career scientists or beginners in bioinformatics to replicate some of these analyses. I am far from an expert programmer or bioinformatician, I spend a lot of time troubleshooting on google, so if anyone finds any problems with my code please let me know! =)
